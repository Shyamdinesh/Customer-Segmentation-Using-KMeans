# Customer-Segmentation-Using-KMeans
Clustering is one of the most common exploratory data analysis technique used to get  an intuition about the structure of the data. It can be defined as the task of identifying  subgroups in the data such that data points in the same subgroup (cluster) are very  similar while data points in different clusters are very different. In other words, we try  to find homogeneous subgroups within the data such that data points in each cluster are  as similar as possible according to a similarity measure such as euclidean-based  distance or correlation-based distance.
Using KMeans Clustering, customers with similar interest are grouped together for the given E-commerce data.
The optimum k value is 6 which means it has formed 6 groups of customers with similar interest.
